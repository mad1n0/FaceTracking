<h3>Why do we collect personal data about you and what do we do with it?</h3>
<p>Develop a framework for visual attention tracking for portable devices.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the App is to provide users with a new type of interactions with portable devices such as smartphones and tablets, without the need of touch gestures, in order to enable them to complete tasks by looking at the mobile phone screen and following with their gaze a marker. For this purpose, we collect and process information, including personal data.</p>
<p>As part of the main purpose of the App, we may also analyze the collected data and use machine learning algorithms to develop models that can track visual attention on the mobile phone screen or measure engagement with various User Interface (UI) elements.</p>
<p>Your consent is the basis for the collection and process of personal data to manage your participation, including data collected through questionnaires. Some personal data collected for this purpose may be considered Biometric Data. You can remove your consent at any time by contacting us in ioannis.arapakis@telefonica.com and kleomenis.katevas@telefonica.com using if possible, the same e-mail address with which you registered in the App.</p>
<p>Provision of basic App services</p>
<p>If you create an account in our App, we will process some personal data for providing basic services of the App such as registration, authentication or support.</p>
<p>As we strictly need some personal data for the functioning of the App, the lawful basis of this processing is the performance of a contract, specifically the Terms & Conditions of the App. Without that information the App wouldn't be functional. Sensitive data is not collected or processed for this purpose.</p>
<p>Improving the functioning of the App and our services</p>
<p>We process personal data to improve the App performance, usability and to provide a better service. This includes aspects related to performance, navigation, availability and usability. To do this we consider things like how often and for how long you use the App, how you navigate between screens, the activities you use, and which screens you spend more time on. We might also ask for your feedback through email or the App.  In some cases, the functionality of the App uses third party services to support analytics and navigation. Our legitimate interest is the legal basis for this processing. Sensitive data is not collected or processed for this purpose.</p>

<p>The App's functionalities require the collection of personal data. Sometimes you provide us with data, sometimes data about you is collected or inferred through your use of the App or generated by us through analysis.</p>
<p>Since our service is focused on the development of a framework for visual attention tracking for portable devices, some of the personal information that you share, or we collect from you, might be related to Biometric Data. See our Terms & Conditions.</p>

<p>When you use the App and complete the designated tasks by using the phone's camera, you share with us the following information:<br />1) Head position and orientation: we will extract a matrix of numbers in order to generate vectors that evaluate your interaction with the mobile phone;<br />2) Eyes position and orientation: we will extract a matrix of numbers in order to generate vector that evaluate your interaction with the mobile phone;<br />3) Eye blinking: we will generate a number between 0 and 1 that indicates how closely are you to have your eyes fully shut or open;<br />4) Eyebrows position: we will generate a number between 0 and 1 that indicates how closely are you to have your eyebrows fully raised or relaxed;<br />5) Jaw position: we will extract a number between 0 and 1 that indicates how closely are you to have your jaw fully open or closed;<br />6) Shape of the environment: we use a module (ARKit), that uses the information provided by the rear camera to generate a 3D model of the surrounding environment. This model can be used to place imaginary models for video games and such or to have a more accurate idea of how the device is moving in order to track better your position;<br />7) Acceleration of the device: we will capture the device acceleration of the device by accessing the accelerometer of the device using SensinfKit, a framework which captures sensor data form iOS devices. The captured data has the shape of a series of decimal numbers that represent accelerations applied to the device.</p>
